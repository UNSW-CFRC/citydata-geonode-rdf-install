NOTE 1 City population has been used as the denominator for this indicator instead of workforce given that population will be known for most cities. This indicator is dependent on the government agency charged with the responsibility of collecting relevant employment and population data and the precise nature of the available data.

Applying current average persons per household figure to all households can lower distinctions between household size in poor and more affluent households.

NOTE 2 Employment is a formal labour market concept which is often complicated in developing countries with a large informal sector of the city economy.

NOTE 3 The Social Responsibility core subjects on Human Rights and Labour Practices from ISO 26000 can be considered, and are particularly useful in regards to child labour.

NOTE 4 The International Labour Organization (ILO) Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work (FPRW) include the elimination of child labour alongside the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining, elimination of forced labour, and the elimination of discrimination in employment or occupation. These fundamental principles and rights at work are mutually interdependent. Violation of one category of rights at work often has an adverse impact on the respect and realization of the others. Vice versa, recognition, promotion and implementation of one category of rights can have a beneficial impact on the respect and realization of the others.

Over the years the international community has developed a framework of international standards which seek to protect children from child labour, in particular the two important ILO Conventions on the subject and more generally the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.[45] Whilst some progress
is being made in reducing child labour, in too many cases the rights contained in these international standards are still not fully applied in practice and enforced. Users of this standard are encouraged to keep these principles in mind."""@en ;
